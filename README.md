# OISP IoT Agent

This project consists of two components:

### oisp-admin
This is a command line "wrapper" for the [REST API](https://github.com/Open-IoT-Service-Platform/platform-launcher/wiki/REST-API), enabling you to test connectivity, activate a device, register time series and send observations all from the command line.

### oisp-agent
This is a "agent" program intended to run as a service. You can send a very simple message, such as:

```
{"n": "temp", "v": 26.9}
```

to a UDP socket on port 41234. The agent will add the security token, add a time stamp, convert "temp" to the component (time series) ID, and send a POST over SSL to an OISP instance.

## Installing using git
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Open-IoT-Service-Platform/oisp-iot-agent.git
cd oisp-iot-agent
npm install
```

#### Configuration
Before using the agent you need to configure it so it knows how to communicate with your OISP instance. The agent looks for the configuration file 'config.json' in the 'config' directory. A template is provided in the 'config' directory which you can copy and modify using your favourite text editor.

``` bash
cp config/config.json.template config/config.json
```
  
#### Testing the connection
Run the following command to test the connection: 
``` bash
./oisp-admin.js test
```

#### Configuring and Activating the Agent

Set a unique Device Id with this command:
``` bash
./oisp-admin.js set-device-id <device_id>
```

You can also set a different Device name with this command:
``` bash
./oisp-admin.js set-device-name <device_name>
```

After the device registration, copy the activation code in _My Account_ UI, tab _Details_ (in _Account_ menu) and execute the activation command:
``` bash
./oisp-admin.js activate <activation_code>     
```
To verify activation, go back to your OISP dashboard and verify the status of the device previously registered.

#### Adding Sensors and Actuators

View in _My Account_ the _Catalog_ tab. You see predefined Sensors and Actuators but can also define your own types. For instance a default sensor is the _temperature.v1.0_ sensor. It can be added by the following command with the name _temp_:
``` bash
./oisp-admin.js register <name> <type>
```
e.g.
``` bash
./oisp-admin.js register temp temperature.v1.0
```

#### Sending Metrics

After that, values for the component _temp_ can be sent by either the _oisp-admin_ to test, e.g.
```
./oisp-admin.js observation temp 22.1
```

or when the oisp-agent is launched, by sending
```
{"n": "temp", "v": 22.1}
```
to a UDP socket on port 41234.

#### Starting the Agent

To start the oisp-agent service simply execute the start script:
``` bash
./oisp-agent.js
```
## Usage

For examples of how to use the 'oisp-agent' please see the [Examples](https://github.com/Open-IoT-Service-Platform/oisp-iot-agent/tree/master/examples) provided.

## Test

The oisp-agent project uses [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/) [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) as its test framework. 
To run all tests:
``` bash
npm install 
./node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt
```

## Certificates

> Do not use the default certificates in production.

The OISP Agent includes default certificates to provide "out of the box" connectivity. These are fine for public data submissions but should not be used for production deployments.

## Using Docker

### Build the image
````bash
make
````

### Start container with bash to configure agent
````bash
make configure
````

### Start container (connect to production server)
````bash
make start
````

### Start container (connect to local server)
````bash
make start-local
````

### Stop container
````bash
make stop
````

### Remove container and image 
````bash
make clean
````
#### Known limitations
 
* Components registered through the OISP Cloud API will not be known by the oisp-agent.
